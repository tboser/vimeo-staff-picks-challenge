I wanted a mood that felt personal and intimate. This was then highlighted by the animation. I wanted this to feel innocent, primitive and bold and I felt the nature of doing this animation for real as camera less animation (a technique pioneered by the incredible Norman McLaren) would capture an insight and honesty that matches the emotion of the track. \r\n\r\nAll animation done by hand directly onto 35mm film. BTS pics below.\r\n\r\nProcess\r\n\r\nWe began by shooting on 35mm film. We almost had an entirely female crew too. Which was great.  Why does this not happen more please!? \r\n\r\nThe film was then scanned and made digital so we could edit it. The day to night timelapse was fun to capture too. I wanted a 7 second timelapse which meant I needed 175 frames. With the help of the awesome DP Katie Swain who designed the lighting to replicate that feeling of daylight changing to nighttime. While nearly all the crew plus the commissioner James Hackett were allocated control over different lights to gradually dim down and up over the 3 minutes we took to execute this effect. We shot 1 frame per sec and ended with 180 frames. \r\n\r\nOnce edited I then worked with an animator to create a digital animatic to give us an indication of what some of the animation might look like on the footage. Thanks Daniel Murtha! \r\n\r\nWe then graded the film and then had the film reprinted back on to 35mm negs which we sent to our animator. Enter the very talented and highly skilled, Em Cooper.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure anything could have prepared us for the delicate execution of painting directly on to exposed film!  Experienced as she was Em had still never painted directly on to the negs.  Em then had to design her own contraption to allow her to go back and forth on the reel. She also ended up using coloured pens instead of paint as she could be more precise on the film and the colours were better. \r\n\r\nFor the initial previews Em took photos on her SLR through a magnify glass which she then collated in an editing programme to make a small preview quicktime. It was quite exhilarating seeing the first preview and watching the concept become tangible. If you look carefully we switch between 25fps and 12.5fps animation and live action at 25fps. As it would have been even more time consuming doing 25fps animation on all clips. But I think this really adds to the charm.  \r\n\r\nWe had 3 rolls of negs for our animator. She only used one and what you see is the one master reel with painted frames. This reel of film is a work of art in it's own right. When the final animated clip was complete the final scan was a crucial step to seeing if it would all work. \r\n\r\nFinally once re-scanned I was surprised by how well the colours came out. We then had minimal tweaking in the final grade for delivery. \r\n\r\nA huge thank you to everyone who believed and made this very unusual project happen.\r\n\r\nSinead Harnett Credits\r\n\r\nDirector \u2013 Zaiba Jabbar\r\n\r\nProduction Company - Partizan\r\n\r\nExecutive Producer \u2013 Claire Stubbs\r\n\r\nProducer \u2013 Douglas Cox\r\n\r\nDirector of Photography \u2013 Katie Swain\r\n\r\nEditor \u2013 Sam Neal\r\n\r\nArt Director \u2013 Ruth Crawford\r\n\r\nAnimation \u2013 Em Cooper - http://www.emcooper.com/\r\n\r\nProduction Manager \u2013 Simona Boulding\r\n\r\n1st Assistant Director \u2013 Cordelia Hardy\r\n\r\nRunner \u2013 Katie Denman\r\n\r\nRunner - Aaron Blanks\r\n\r\nDriver \u2013 Dimitri Topalov\r\n\r\n1st Assistant Camera \u2013 Hilda Sealey\r\n\r\nClapper Loader \u2013 Nick Thursby\r\n\r\nGaffer \u2013 Steve Cortie\r\n\r\nElectrician \u2013 Michael Parsons\r\n\r\nArt Assistant \u2013 Victor Jakubski\r\n\r\nStylist \u2013 Nell Kalonji\r\n\r\nAssistant Stylist \u2013 Rosie\r\n\r\nMakeup \u2013 Charlotte Reid\r\n\r\nHair \u2013 Oliver Wood\r\n\r\nChoreographer \u2013 Ida May\r\n\r\nCommisioner \u2013 James Hackett\r\n\r\nAssistant Editor \u2013 Aurelien Boisson\r\n\r\nAnimatic \u2013 Daniel Murtha - http://www.danielmurtha.com/\r\n\r\nColourist \u2013 Marty McMullen\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks \u2013 Amy Armstrong, Ella Lynch, Jon Mealing, Suzi Sims, David Webb, \r\n\r\nAndrew Alexander & Julian Culme-Seymore", "thumbnail": "https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/517405039_780x439.webp", "categories": [0, 9, 111, 17], "clip_id": "126822765"}, {"title": "Dodoba (\u3069\u3069\u3070\uff09", "caption": "In the village of Dodoba, a toad must face trial over the murder of a frog.\r\n\r\nHere's my graduation film from CalArts!!\r\nThanks to all my friends and family who supported me along the way!!\r\n\r\nClick on \"CC\" to turn on subtitles.\r\n\r\nMusic by:\r\nDaiki Okuno (Taiko)\r\nKozue Matsumoto (Koto)\r\nLily (Ajisai no Uta - Music and lyrics)\r\n\r\nFrench and English Subtitles provided by SHOCO.\r\nThey're awesome to work with!

Our very first mission was actually to help another company (Quixel) with some live-action shots/scenes to simply showcase their new texture-tool for 3d-models in games and movies, but instead we came up with this concept idea and created a full blown short film. Primarily, we wanted to do something visual and entertaining to simply present this concept and showcase Quixel's tools.\r\nWe did almost everything our self (with some 3d/texture/sfx help) and we used close friends/family members to be \"actors\", including myself playing the main character. So I guess that's why the acting isn't top notch and why we didn't use so much dialogue ;) BUT we also wanted to keep it very visual, we wanted to tell a story with pictures (and UI-text of course). That was a big challenge but I think we succeeded. In the end we're happy with the end result considering the conditions and people really seem to like it!

Like an Internet-age spiritual successor to MTV\u2019s beloved 120 MINUTES & LIQUID TELEVISION, this ten-episode series aims to create an online safe haven for boundary-pushing, transgressive, proudly weird American filmmaking. \r\n\r\nFrom v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary to amateur computer animation; surreal horror to remix video art; haunted high school yearbooks to Sasquatch birth rituals; time traveling cats to live web streams of your own birth -- if it sounds too strange for Netflix, chances are you'll find it on THE EYESLICER.\r\n\r\nTo watch the full ten-episode, ten-hour first season of The Eyeslicer for the price of an email address, visit http://www.theeyeslicer.com/secret_code and answer the following trivia question: Who does 'Twin Peaks' and 'Sunset Boulevard' have in common? (answer in one-word, all-caps).\r\n\r\n\"Lovers Sleep Together\" is the 8th episode of the series. It's all about love, relationships, and sex. It features: \r\n\r\n\"Gwilliam,\" dir.
