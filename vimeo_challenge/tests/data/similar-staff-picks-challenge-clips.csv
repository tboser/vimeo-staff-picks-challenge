In a world where live-action and animation are growing closer and closer to one another, Richard Williams was and still is one of the last remaining members of the old guard who wanted to push animation in the exact opposite direction, to do what no other medium can, and that's perhaps most evident in the masterful way in which his films move. Let's dive in and see what we can learn.

15,247839331,SUPERPOSITION,"To optimize your experience,you can use headset and light free environment with fullscreen resolution.

Superposition is an experimental short film. “Superposition"" is actually the “quantum theory that describes a challenging concept about the nature and behavior of matter and forces at the sub-atomic level. The principle of superposition claims that while we do not know what the state of any object is, it is actually in all possible states simultaneously, as long as we don't look to check. It is the measurement itself that causes the object to be limited to a single possibility”.  In the film, the character desires to break that possibility, she experienced it infinitely but the chances of her breaking single possibility are equal to herself. Every time she is born, she becomes conscious all over again and she doesn’t even know who she is and what she has to do. She is part of the environment but she just doesn’t want to be. She lives in pure white and just wants to live in a little bit of grey. However, if you live in a world where the answers are obvious, a little bit of grey can change the whole picture. One day when you look for the place you last put your key, the universe might collapse until you find it.

Tuscan cuisine, incredible boutique shopping, and mesmerizing views at every turn, the city of Florence is nothing short of spectacular. Known worldwide as the birthplace of the Renaissance, Florence embodies the spirit of ancient Italy and has managed to preserve it for nearly 700 years. With over 350,000 who call the city home, and nearly 1.5 million who reside in its surrounding metropolitan area, Florence skillfully fuses the past with the present, creating a unique time capsule of ancient aesthetics housed within a hustling, bustling world of modern day Italy.
Containing a wealth of preserved artistic and architectural masterpieces, the city is home to almost one-third of the world’s artistic treasures, according to UNESCO, an organization which designates world heritage sites to preserve the world’s most important cultural locations and artifacts. With a near countless number of art galleries and over 45 museums – including the Uffizi gallery, the world’s best collection of Italian Renaissance art, and the Galleria dell'Accademia, home to the legendary statue of David – it is no wonder why the city captures the hearts and imaginations of all who visit. From the ancient churches and stunning buildings that line the city streets to the priceless artistic masterpieces created by Michelangelo, Botticelli, and Giotto housed within Florence’s galleries, the city is bursting with art and culture.
Florence’s influence can be felt in more than just the world of art. The capital of the region of Tuscany, Florence is the birthplace of the Italian language. It was famed Italian author Dante Alighieri and other writers such as Boccaccio and Petrarca who were the first to begin writing in a language other than Latin. Florence was also the first city in all of Europe to have paved streets. With its rich history and incomparable influence on modern Italian life, Florence certainly changed the way that most view Italy.

Una città che ha mantenuto inalterato il proprio fascino e lo splendore del passato. Così si presenta Firenze, capoluogo della Toscana. Una città incantevole che non smette mai di sorprendere, con i suoi capolavori d’arte, i marmi colorati delle chiese e le architetture che ne rievocano il fasto e il ruolo svolto nello sviluppo della cultura e dell’arte rinascimentale.
Cuore pulsante di Firenze è Piazza del Duomo, con il complesso monumentale della Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore - sormontato dalla maestosa cupola del Brunelleschi -, il Battistero di San Giovanni - magnifico esempio di romanico fiorentino -, il Campanile di Giotto - un capolavoro di architettura gotica fiorentina.
Alle spalle del Duomo sorge il Museo dell’Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore, dove è possibile ammirare una preziosa raccolta di opere provenienti dalla Cattedrale, dal Battistero e dal Campanile.
Piazza della Signoria rappresenta il polo storico della vita civile e ospita la trecentesca Loggia dei Lanzi, la Fontana di Nettuno e il Palazzo della Signoria o Palazzo Vecchio, uno dei monumenti-simbolo della città, davanti al quale sorgono alcune famose statue tra cui una copia del famoso David di Michelangelo.
Accanto alla piazza vi è la maestosa Galleria degli Uffizi, sede di uno dei musei più importanti del mondo, che include opere di Botticelli, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci e molti altri grandi artisti. Elemento architettonico di particolare rilievo della Galleria è il Corridoio Vasariano progettato dal Vasari alla metà del Cinquecento che collega la struttura con Palazzo Vecchio e con Palazzo Pitti.",2017-12-18T10:51:13-05:00,486448886,178,247820432,36,40381,1149,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/673174954_780x439.webp

25,244729509,THE BAIL PROJECT,"The Bronx Freedom Fund pays the bail for people accused of misdemeanors who cannot afford their freedom. Who are these people? They are often the most vulnerable in our community and those with the least public voice. They are people like Ramel. 
 
Having Ramel share his story with us was transformative – to be innocent and have your liberty denied is a national shame. His story galvanized us to make this film because his voice not only deserves to be heard, but needs to be heard. His courage, resolve and compassion is an inspiration and it’s time to shine a light on this grave injustice being visited upon far too many of our fellow citizens. 
 
The Bronx Freedom Fund, and now the national Bail Project, is doing their part – Ramel’s story is a stirring reminder that it’s up to all of us to step up and do ours.

The Bail Project is an unprecedented national effort to combat mass incarceration by keeping tens of thousands of low-income Americans out of pretrial detention. The organization grows out of The Bronx Freedom Fund and will expand to dozens of high-need jurisdictions with the goal of reducing the unacceptable human suffering caused by unaffordable cash bail and supporting community efforts to end the racial disparities endemic to this system.

34,242337463,500 MILES,"TEXT 500MILES TO 71777 TO DONATE AND SUPPORT OUR MISSION

The purpose of this innovative short film is to start a new, universally-understood conversation around the necessity of struggle, challenge and perseverance as they relate to creating meaning in one's life - without one, you cannot have the other. The 500 Miles film communicates the importance of this concept by telling the story of the un-purposed wild mustang and the un-purposed veteran, following both as they learn to face and navigate challenges, with the ultimate goal of discovering what their greater purpose in life is. For these mustangs, the arduous 500 mile journey through New Mexico and Arizona was their purpose-defining challenge, but we all have our own version of a ""500 mile journey"". It's the moments in life when we choose to buck up instead of give up. When we choose to take the unbeaten path instead of the easy road. It's the moments that force us to take a hard look at ourselves, and the decisions we have been making, and decide if we have been letting life happen to us, or for us.

So, the question is: What's your 500?

“We travel along the coastline for several days. All we need fits in our waterproof and floatable backpacks. We set out to explore nature and what we carry with us is reduced to a minimum. We dive deep into the ocean and swim along wild cliffs, discovering untouched beaches where we spend our nights under the clear sky.”        - Bernhard Wache, Founder of Seatrekking.

It has been almost twelve years since Bernhard and a group of friends started developing a new sport they ended up naming SEATREKKING. It began with the simple idea of spending as much time as possible near and in the ocean.

Over the years Seatrekking became more than a sport. It became a philosophy.

41,241055783,"""Lovers Sleep Together"" -- Sneak Preview Episode of 'The Eyeslicer'","""One of the craziest TV shows you'll ever see. It could revolutionize short film distribution."" -Indiewire

Fresh off its premiere at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, THE EYESLICER is a new hourlong 'secret TV show' from the bizarre minds of Dan Schoenbrun and Vanessa McDonnell (COLLECTIVE:UNCONSCIOUS). Like an Internet-age spiritual successor to MTV’s beloved 120 MINUTES & LIQUID TELEVISION, this ten-episode series aims to create an online safe haven for boundary-pushing, transgressive, proudly weird American filmmaking. 

From vérité documentary to amateur computer animation; surreal horror to remix video art; haunted high school yearbooks to Sasquatch birth rituals; time traveling cats to live web streams of your own birth -- if it sounds too strange for Netflix, chances are you'll find it on THE EYESLICER.

To watch the full ten-episode, ten-hour first season of The Eyeslicer for the price of an email address, visit http://www.theeyeslicer.com/secret_code and answer the following trivia question: Who does 'Twin Peaks' and 'Sunset Boulevard' have in common? (answer in one-word, all-caps).

""Lovers Sleep Together"" is the 8th episode of the series. It's all about love, relationships, and sex. It features:

One part of it was a cg-short with spray cans flying around in a for of letter T — the main element of a new id-system that ONY had made for the Gallery. The point was to complement a real camera shot and make a sort of transition to cg-graphic so we could easily present the id-style on different mediums using cg. After work was done I have challenged myself to do a similar short for every Gallery's direction — classic paintings, modern art, franchise and others — which presented by seven colours in id-system.",2017-10-24T04:56:23-04:00,355800796,108,239604078,10,326178,920,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/662905002_780x439.webp

The area is changing. People are disappearing. What has that got to do with coffee?

Written and directed by actor and playwright Nathaniel Martello White, CLA’AM is a short film about a man who notices that his area is changing and suspects that darkness may be afoot. As Hog, a long time resident of a certain south London district known as Cla’am searches for his friend JJ, he starts to see patterns and signs pointing to a mysterious plot. But no one will listen to him. As the mystery deepens CLA’AM is the story of Hog’s mission to expose the conspiracy, and save his friend. Is it all in his head? Or might the disappearance of the locals really be somehow connected to all the new coffee shops.

65,237715420,A Young Caregiver’s Letter to Her Father with Alzheimer’s,"When Melissa’s Dad was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s, she was only 14 years old. 

It changed the family dynamics, and she was forced to grow up to take on the responsibility of a caregiver for her Dad. “Our roles reversed,” she said. “I had to be the parent.” 

We tend to think of dementia as a condition that primarily affects older persons, and issues of early-onset are often overlooked, including its impact on family members.   

The challenges that young caregivers face are unique, especially with having to cope with the struggles of adolescence, alongside competing demands of school and caregiving.

Melissa is working to address this gap through Project We Forgot, a community platform she kickstarted, which offers support for young caregivers of persons with dementia. 

Melissa wished that she was more informed about her Dad’s condition so that she could be a better caregiver, amidst having to come to terms with his memory loss and confusion.

“No one taught us how to feel when we watched you slowly slip away, or how to react when your memories started fading, and you stopped remembering who we were.” 

She wrote these words in a letter to her Dad more than ten years later. Had she known better as a teenager, perhaps there could have been more empathy and understanding.   

There was no one she could confide with in school, seeing that there was hardly any awareness about issues of dementia amongst her circle of friends and teachers.

With lessons learned from her own experience, Melissa hopes that young caregivers won’t have to feel the same isolation like she did. Through Project We Forgot, they can access resources and be connected with others who are going through similar journeys.

At the same time, Melissa actively reaches out to different institutions around Singapore to help raise awareness and support for the needs of caregivers at school or the workplace. 

Meaningful change can only happen when there’s increased public education, she feels. 

Reflecting on her journey, Melissa sees a large part of her Dad in who she is now, especially his entrepreneurial spirit, which gave her the impetus to kickstart Project We Forgot.

“I hope that I’m doing you proud, Dad.” She tells him as she ends her letter.

70,238096496,THE LOCAL: The Master Carver,"In this pilot film, we follow Master carver and indigenous Alaskan artist Wayne Price as he creates fine art in the traditional style of the Tlingit people. Wayne’s artistic creations cover a broad range of design and artifacts, including totem poles, dugout canoes, masks, paddles, clan hats and jewelry. Wayne works with local youth to pass on the craft and culture of the Tlingit people. Wayne takes us on a journey as he builds an adze, a traditional Tlingit wood-carving tool used by his ancestors for thousands of years.

The Local is a Royal Caribbean original series, celebrating people from around the world, their unique passions and their culture. 
For the premiere season, we highlight three locals from Alaska: Wayne Price, Mary Smith and Dan Oberlatz.

We embarked August 2017 expecting to live a romantic long train journey, but it wasn’t only that: we enjoyed 2 weeks of absorbing and great experiences, both on the train and in the cities we visited. We departed from Moscow and stopped in Ekaterinburg, Irkutsk, Baikal Lake and Ulan-Ude, the formerly closed city in which we took the Trans-Mongolian route to UlaanBaatar to after visit the spectacular Mongolian countryside.
101 years after it was completed, the Trans-Siberian still keeps the tranquility and nostalgia of an historical ride.

91,235226558,SOLO NYC (Full Film),"SOLO NYC is an intimate look at the trials and triumphs of New York’s rising class of creative freelancers.

About SOLO NYC:

In the alleyways, back kitchens and matchbox studios tucked away in countless of bustling, yet remarkably unglamorous, neighborhoods wedged within the most vibrant city in the world, there’s magic is happening. Every damn day.

New York’s professional style understated yet relentless. Showing up, doing your best—and doing things a little differently—is the mantra of millions of people who rise with the sun to chase their dreams. With a little luck and a lot of sweat, millions of men and women are making their career ambitions happen, and doing so outside of the traditional career path.

92,234536729,PlayTime- Controlled Chaos,"I think Jacques Tati's PlayTime is one of the unrivaled great films of all time, but rather than talk about its socio-economic commentary or its myriad of slapstick gags, let's take a minute to dive into its extraordinary (and extraordinarily fun) Royal Garden sequence, and explore the inner workings of chaos unfolding.

Little Pink picks a daisy chain – awww, great!
Little Blue picks a daisy chain - gay
Little Blue climbs the tree – strong boy

Pink shoes – no grip

Now Blue legs start growing hairs

Gabe Askew has long collaborated with the musician duo Hays + Ryan Holladay who were responsible for putting the series together. They leveraged the new Dolby Atmos technology to create a beautiful and embracing soundscape while Gabe tried to wrap his head around the massive 9920x720 resolution display. The theme of the series was memory. Drawing from the writings of Ray Kurzweil, Gabe created a visual metaphor for the physical act of how the brain receives a stimulus, breaks it down into elements, stores it via pattern receptors in the cerebral cortex, and then recalls it. The specific memory represented in the film is the birth of his daughter, Lily.

135,226771837,FRANCO PASCALI,"When I met Franco Pascali, I was struck by how much I felt like I was meeting and hanging out with a young street skater. However, instead of witnessing skate tricks he destroyed me by his usage of cards. Much like the world of skateboarding that I was raised in, magic and cardistry are intensely personal and individually orientated in terms of the endless practice that is required to master them. Tricks are performed with decks and each person embodies a style that is distinctly their own. That style is reflective of the influences they devoured when they were coming up and their intrinsic sensibility that they develop as they mature. As I spent time with Franco I immediately wanted to point my camera at him to capture the way he dressed, the way he talked, the breathtaking way he moved cards and the feeling I had in encountering such raw talent. This is our first film.

Franco Pascali is 19 years-old and lives in Los Angeles. He is a director of magic at Theory11.

136,225956849,EPIC FAIL,"In a time where post-truth news divides and conservative politics fails to lure in young voters, a extraordinary vote for world peace has dramatic consequences.
Epic Fail is an avant-garde essay that questions how we perceive truth, information and politics, seen through the dual lenses of our real and virtual identities.

Moved by the political events that shook 2016, the film is inspired by Jean Paul Sartre’s “Nausea”; or how we can develop visual embodiments of our emotions as a catharsis on how to deal with reality.

25 world-famous artists including Grayson Perry, David Shrigley and Sir Antony Gormley were asked to turn a piece of charcoal salvaged from the Mackintosh Building fire into art. The work was auctioned at Christie’s to fund the rebuild.

The film was commissioned by J. Walter Thompson (JWT London) and produced at Jelly London.

Ash To Art animation is shortlisted in the Animation category at Cannes Lions 2017.

169,221441846,Symmetry: Behind the laws of nature,"Symmetry underlines our whole understanding of the universe. And the deeper we look, the more symmetries we find, reflecting our world in new and beautiful ways. 

Symmetry is vital to understanding and predicting how our universe works. The relationship between symmetry and the mechanics of the universe is fundamental to physics. From Noether’s theorem to the new and exciting world of local symmetries being revealed by modern day physics, Tara Shears explores the physics of symmetry.

By revealing nature’s parameters, symmetry gives definition to the world as we understand it. It is a fundamental principle that makes phenomena repeatable and predictable.  But if symmetries are so pervasive and influential in our world, why do we see so much asymmetry and chaos?

171,221351889,Travelling Through Brush and Ink | National Palace Museum Taiwan 筆墨行旅 | 台灣故宮 逐格動畫,"Watch ""Behind the Scene"" here: https://vimeo.com/224334164

**Winner of Worldfest Huston International Film Festival 2017**
""Travelling Through Brush and Ink"" is a stop-motion animation of a little modern man traveling through four significant ancient Chinese paintings, transforming himself into animals and plants, and becomes part of the nature. Each painting represents four important stages of landscape art in Chinese history. Based on the original paintings, we built the sets and animated little character inside- all frame by frame. The animation is the opening film of 2016 annual exhibition National Palace Museum Taiwan.

**2017休士頓國際影展動畫獎得主**
“筆墨行旅”故事敘述一個現代男子進入畫中世界展開旅程，在旅程中形變成動物或植物，與自然合而為一。動畫中的四個場景分別為四幅歷史上重要的中國山水畫，畫中景色被製作成真實模型場景，人物和動植物在其中全是逐格拍攝。
四幅畫分別為唐代〈明皇幸蜀圖〉、北宋〈谿山行旅圖〉、南宋〈巖關古寺〉及元代〈鵲華秋色圖〉，呈現中國山水畫講求可行、可望、可遊、可居之意境，為中國山水畫的歷代風格演變的代表。本動畫是台灣國立故宮博物院2016年度典藏展的開幕片。

2017 Great Big Story Awards - “Story that Inspires Hope” Award 
2017 Hatch Awards - Best Use of Branded Content (Silver)

In the wake of Katrina, New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward was one of the few neighborhoods where relief came slowly. Less than 25% of its pre-Katrina population has returned and many houses have been abandoned or mowed down. As a result, the USDA officially listed the neighborhood as a “food desert”, defined as urban areas without access to affordable food in a five-mile radius.

Burnell Cotlon returned to his home neighborhood in 2007 and was dismayed by what he saw. He pleaded with major chain stores to open up in the Ward, but the ongoing reconstruction and slow repopulation kept them away.

Cotlon decided he’d open up his own shops and restore the community one small business at a time. He learned carpentry and electrical work through YouTube videos so that he could build all his operations on a budget. To date, he’s opened a grocery store, a market, a barbershop, and a laundromat all in an effort to centralize and revitalize pride for the Ward.

When you can’t taste every ingredient. When you don’t see the hours of thought, and practice, and trial, and error. When you can do more, but less is more powerful. When you express yourself purely, simply. There’s greatness in simplicity, but it isn’t simple.

191,193330065,張靓潁Jane Zhang - Dust My Shoulders Off -MV,"*影像工作邀約來信請至 (Outerspace studio)
Any work invitations please mail us: 
fxxkleo@hotmail.com 

Singer Zhang Liangying, portrays the role of an office lady and was presented at the beginning of the story. This unlucky lady was blamed by her boss over the phone when she visited the Art Institute of Chicago. Suddenly, she enters a world of famous paintings, and was on her way to a fantastic adventure.

In this MV, we try to connect 12 world-known paintings through interesting and smooth transitions. The original values of those paintings are re-defined. For example, Van Gogh’s ear is bitten by Mike Tyson; when the girl in the Gleaners looks up, she becomes the Girl with A Pearl Earring; the two men in black at the end of the bridge in the Scream by Edvard Munch are actually MIB, and they scream because they see the big monster in the painting of Dali; and the man in suit sitting with his back to us in the lonely café of the last painting Nighthawks, is Dali, and so on.

The 3D effect of those famous paintings is the largest challenge in this MV. We invited excellent artists to contribute their ideas and skills on all the scenes, costumes, actors and the singer. The innovative shooting methods are extremely experimental, which seems crazy!

Although the concept of the script is radical, weird and wild, the revival of paintings, the integration of the new and the old, the copy of painting lines and the texture presentation in the production process are all challenges. The traditional arts and aesthetics are supported by creativity, and innovative story line and the overwhelming CG are integrated. The MV was made possible through the efforts of experts in various fields. We hope you enjoy it!

The list of paintings and artists used in the MV:
1. Edward Hopper – Nighthawks
2. Vincent Willem van Gogh
3. Jean-François Millet- Des glaneuses
4. Johannes Vermeer-Het meisje met de parel
5.Andrew Nowell Wyeth-Christina's World
6.Georges-Pierre Seurat-Un dimanche après-midi à l'Île de la Grande Jatte
7. Edvard Munch-Skrik
8.alvador Dali-A Tentação de Santo Antônio
9. The marches of summer
10. Maurits Cornelis Escher-Ascending and descending
11. Maurits Cornelis Escher- Gallery
12. Magritte Rene-The Son of Man
13. Salvador Dali

* As for the 13th painting, the explosion at 1:35 of the MV adopts the style of Japanese artist, Yayoi Kusama.


故事的開始，從歌手張靚穎所扮演的OL上班族拉開序幕，電話那頭傳來老闆的責駡，正在逛芝加哥美術館( Art Institute of Chicago)的倒楣OL，莫名闖入名畫的世界，展開一連串不可思議的奇幻冒險。

此MV我們嘗試以有趣流暢的轉場,貫穿12幅世界名畫，並且顛覆改寫原先名畫的世界觀，做出了全新的定義，例如：梵谷的耳朵原來是被拳王泰森給咬下來的、拾穗中間彎著腰的女性抬起頭來，原來是戴珍珠耳環的少女、孟克吶喊那座橋後方的兩個黑衣人原來是MIB，而吶喊的原因是看到了達利畫中的巨大神獸所以尖叫吶喊、而最後名畫Nighthawks寂寞咖啡廳裡背對西裝男，竟然是達利的背影……等等。

為了讓平面經典以3D重現，將名畫""立體化""是此次MV最大的挑戰，我們找來了優秀的藝術畫家們，將所有看的到的搭景、服裝、甚至演員與歌手全都畫上了""筆觸""，""極不正常""的MV拍攝手法，極度實驗性的拍攝現場，只有瘋狂！

雖然劇本創意不按牌理出牌，也可以說非常""前衛另類＆狂野""，但回歸現實製作層面，如何呈現畫作本質並賦予新的生命，新舊衝突的融合、筆觸的臨摹、質感呈現更是實際我們要克服的一大挑戰。以正統藝術與美感為基底，創意為輔，融入超展開的惡搞劇情，加上目不暇給的CG動畫特效，這是各方專業跨界努力後的成果，請開心享用!

此外，值得一提的是歌手張靚穎的勇氣與野心，沒有底線、不給創作者任何框架的創作空間，就算是被顏料畫得面目全非也盡力配合，求得只是一個創意的完整，這是身為一個主流歌手非常難能可貴的，你去看看那些主流的CD封面或MV就可充分瞭解這其中的突破了，華語歌手總是被要求臉要清楚、要大、要美、舞蹈要好記.....創意總是被放在很後面，而這MV最令人振奮的是，我們終於可以把創意放在第一位了!!!

198,217958236,Note to Self,"Unfinished business is the worst and a couple things have consistently hovered over my conscience over the past few years. The first being a bundle of beautiful footage sitting unused on a hard drive (from a scrapped music video o' mine) - the second being the way I ended a rather delightful little summer rendezvous. Both contain content recorded during completely different chapters (even cities) of my life yet for some reason, when I connected the two, all felt right in the world and I'd even argue it was almost as if they were waiting on the other to be a complete(d) piece. That piece is now viewable in the form of a short titled “Note to Self."" 

All I will say as a disclaimer is that what it lacks in length I hope it makes up for in honesty, heart and vulnerability as it’s filled from start to finish with a good deal of mine.",2017-05-18T03:19:20-04:00,362331573,120,217958236,45,185060,1188,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/635306413_780x439.webp

221,203983112,Magnitude Rituals 지진영제(地震禜祭),"The earthquake of M5.8, the largest on the Korean Peninsula, occurred in Korea, which was called the ""Earthquake Safety Zone,"" in 2016. Gyeongju City suffered a great deal of damage due to the ineffectiveness of the Korean government and the insecurity of safety. By the year 2017, there have been about 500 aftershocks, and Koreans are living in fear of an earthquake that will happen anytime soon.

Magnitude Rituals is an image of praying that no earthquake will happen in Korea. The former Korean peninsula country, which was a farming country, had a ritual to pray for rain in the sky every drought season. In this regard, this work expresses a ritual to wish an earthquake not to happen. The image consists of two frames. The image on the left represents the progress of the ritual, and the image on the right represents the earthquake where its value of the graph representing the earthquake converges to zero and the process of the earthquake is reversed.

What I wanted to pursue in my work was the communication of messages using the contrast of Korean traditional and shamanic images and sophisticated mathematical graphics. On the surface, it appears to be unrelated images, but as the ritual process progresses, it expresses that the figure indicating the earthquake in the graph subsides, and the audience will be able to gradually understand and appreciate the images.

‘지진안전지대’라고 불리던 한국에 2016년 경주에서 한반도 최대 규모 M5.8의 지진이 발생하였다. 한국 정부의 미숙한 대처와 안전불감증의 분위기 속에 경주시는 큰 피해를 보았다. 2017년 현재까지 500여 차례의 여진이 발생하면서, 한국 국민은 언제 일어날지 모르는 지진을 두려워하며 살고 있다.

지진영제(地震禜祭)는 대한민국에서 더는 지진이 일어나지 않길 기원하는 제사를 그린 영상이다. 농본 국가였던 대한민국 이전 한반도 국가는 가뭄 시기마다 하늘에 비를 기원하는 제사를 지냈다. 이에 착안하여 이 작업은 지진이 일어나지 않기를 기원하는 제사를 표현하였다. 영상은 두 개의 프레임으로 구성된다. 왼쪽 영상은 제사의 진행 과정을 표현하고, 오른쪽 영상은 지진을 나타내는 그래프의 값이 0으로 수렴하는 모습과 지진이 발생하는 과정이 거꾸로 진행되는 모습을 표현했다. 

작업하면서 가장 추구하고 싶었던 것은 한국 전통과 무속 이미지와 정교한 수학적 그래픽 간의 대조 속에서의 메시지 전달이었다. 겉으로 보기에는 서로 간에 연관성이 없어 보이는 이미지이지만, 제사가 진행되면서 그래프 속의 지진을 나타내는 수치가 멎어 들고 있음을 표현하여 관객이 영상을 감상하면서 천천히 이해할 수 있기를 바랐다.

We made this film for Rapha, featuring cycling legend and overall wonderful soul, Connie Carpenter. The original brief was to make a short snapshot about the cycling culture of Boulder, but after they gave us Connie Carpenter as the narrator, the film took on a life of its own. 

Thank you Connie, for letting us into your life for a couple of days. May more of us have a similar outlook on life one day.

226,215510559,She's All That and the Power of Transformation,"She’s All That introduced American teenagers to high-stakes bets in their high school halls. If Freddie Prinze Jr. was gonna make the dorky Laney Boggs prom queen, he was gonna need to give her an extreme makeover because as it is, she’s ugly — she has glasses, a bad haircut and she doesn’t tweeze her eyebrows. This movie shows us her transformation in a highly entertaining 90 minutes. At first, audiences must sit there and think, “There’s no way,” but by the end you’re seeing she’s actually pretty hot and has a decent shot at beating Taylor Vaughn for prom queen. So sit back and relax and enjoy my video essay and make sure to watch till the end as I edit together a special “what if” ending. Also, be sure to go re-watch this iconic movie from 1999 that was made by Miramax Films.

228,214947122,LOVE,"We are excited to announce Jonathan Rentschler’s photobook “LOVE” now available to order through Paradigm Publishing and a short film to promote the book documenting the last days of LOVE Park and the destruction of the plaza.

About the book:

LOVE follows the last generation of LOVE Park inhabitants and reveals life as it was within this notorious urban plaza. The images, gathered over a three-year span, tell the story of a deeply rooted community shadowed by a police state and a biased city government.

Ultimately the victim of urban revitalization, the park closed in February 2016 for a $16 million complete renovation. But the diehard locals refused to leave, continuing to skate the plaza even as it turned to rubble. In the end, LOVE is a narrative about loss.

About LOVE Park:

LOVE Park (1965-2016), also known as John F. Kennedy Plaza, was located in the center of Philadelphia. Architect Vincent Kling drafted the mid-century urban design, which was then implemented by city planner Edmund Bacon. Although it was not designed for skateboarding, the plaza was host to a wave of skateboarders who first discovered its granite expanses as early as the 1980s. It was raised to global renown in the late ’90s with a surge of media coverage. Today, LOVE Park is remembered as one of the foremost landmarks of street skateboarding.

Maybe we like it or maybe we don't like it. But love is a whole thing, we are only pieces. It's about suffering, growth and change. After embracing all, you'll find it a beautiful peaceful thing.

People should be happy. Even this Egyptian goose, who tries to cast a spell on us with a seductive dance. Its gracious and clumsy movements captivate us. But it’s not the only one to master the dance. Three flocks of geese each led by their guru goose also share the pond; all of them torn between their desire to express their own individuality and the urge for group behavior. Soon the water begins to rise. Never mind. The geese will keep on dancing for us until they drown.
A video about the search for ones own identity through seemingly audacious self-expression on the one hand and the undeniable drowning into the masses on the other.

Rotterdam based singer/songwriter Mark Lotterman found a very special way to release his 5th record, HOLLAND. He asked painters, filmmakers, writers, scientists, and photographers to contribute something to one of the songs from the album.

Synopsis: When I was leaving for college, my aunt Dana told me I had a cousin I’d never met who was matriculating in the same year as me. We shared classes and had friends in common but for some strange reason I never introduced myself. All during college, and then into the real world, through a decade of overlapping connections, we never met. This film is an examination of that hesitation and an attempt to understand why I never made the easiest connection in the world… until it was too late. Through archival footage and re-enactment of the era in question, IDAC is ultimately a documentary about what was happening on an unconscious level and how distant a relative can be even when they’re right in front of your face.

Production Notes: I've made over 100 short films, many of which examine issues of family, the blurry line between fiction and non-fiction and the sometimes disturbing, sometimes hilarious ways our memories fail us. IDAC is an autobiographical documentary which is a genre my movies (or at least parts of them) often fall into. The key with autobiography in my opinion is to avoid being sentimental at all costs. This does not mean you can’t be funny or can’t be authentic and personal – it’s just that it being your story does not automatically make it interesting. On top of that, IDAC also considers the way we dream and the way dreams can invade our everyday life – which is another subject matter that can easily steer a film awry. So making IDAC was exciting because once mindful of all these pitfalls, there was an enormous feeling of restraint that coursed through the documentary’s production. My hope is that people who see my film IDAC recognize familiar moments and feelings from their own lives: memories they can’t quite explain, people they think they know and dramatic, life-defining events that upon further scrutiny don’t exactly add up as neatly as they once thought.

In 10 days we slept several nights beneath one of the most breathtaking night skies there are in the whole world, visited ghost town, a forgotten village which used to be a leper colony until it was abandoned, and found a lost hotel, which's construction was suddenly stopped in the 70s because the owner was unknown.
We gathered 42.187 shots which kept us over 240 hours busy in post production and take up 1,12 Terra bytes of our hard drives.

First, the soundtrack was composed according along the theme ""Life"". Nobumichi Asai and Shingo Abe was inspired by the music and then made face mapping work. Aya Sato designed choreography. TOKYO completed the project by making the video work.

The music brought Asai the image of “the radioactive.” The destructive force of the radioactive could cause “death,” “suffering,” and “sorrow.” And “prayers” could overcome them. These subjects infuse AYABAMBI’s powerful performance. Their performance crushes and conquer black tears, skulls and the Heart Sutra. We built up the concept during the production and Abe designed animation for face mapping.

There was a big challenge in technical aspects. We realized the new mapping system that allows us to follow intense performances by using the latest 1,000 fps projector, DynaFlash(*1) and a super speed sensor. It is very new and it had not been done before. Projected images become part of their skin and they transform their faces.

At the beginning of our development, there was an issue, AYABAMBI would loose freedom of performances if we accelerated the tracking speed. Asai, Yoshimura (WOW), Lecturer Watanabe and Teshima (EXVISION) explored how we could keep the tracking speed securing the freedom of performances, taking three months of trial and error to reduce a few milliseconds. And we finally developed this system(*2).


*1 “DynaFlash” is developed jointly by Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory, the University of Tokyo and is commercialized by Tokyo Electron Device Limited. 

*2 For tracking hands, we use the dynamic projection mapping technology developed by Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory, the University of Tokyo. For tracking faces, we use the face mapping technology developed by the visual design studio, WOW inc.",2017-03-29T09:23:35-04:00,1510782804,71,210599507,73,477215,6741,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/626430256_780x439.webp

Richard’s father is also a wood worker and carpenter and has led his son into the beautiful world of working with wood. Richard has gone through all the traditional steps of becoming a master woodworker - starting from an apprentice, then journeyman and then receiving his Master degree in Latvian chamber of crafts. Richard’s passion to wood is not only sculpturing and carving it but also knowing the wood in a scientific level. So Richard has studied in Technical university as a student and reached his degree of Doctor in engineering materials science, so he has combined the craft, nature and science in his life and work. While working in furniture making during the studies, with making different kinds of difficult wood carving for Jugend, Barrocal, Renesance design style furniture, Richard has discovered that he tends to get back to more rustic, robust and natural forms of wood, so he created a park of massive wooden sculptures, wood crafts museum and live workshop where Richard lives and creates wooden bowls, plates, boats and accepts visitors to share his work and lifestyle.

Film is done entirely in screen-printing technique, which means that all the frames were drawn by hand, turned into colour separations and screen printed on A3 sheets of paper, then scanned back in to create an animated sequence. More than 400 screen prints were created while making the film.

Film is based on a story ""Goats Eyes"" by Max Frei.

Μy last trip to Norway during February, 2017.
The Lofoten Archipelago is spread on the northwest side of Norway, very close to the borders of the Arctic Circle. It is a cluster of small fishing villages and is often called “the Foot of the lynx” because of its shape.
 The islands are full of legends, maybe because of their natural beauty and their mysterious landscapes, or maybe because there the Sun either never rises or never sets. The only thing you can hear is the thousand voices of birds, the wind and the sound of the sea. That combination of the landscape which comes into view every morning and the sounds of nature is a priceless experience that fills you with energy and inspiration for the whole day, no matter what you have to face.

Probably because upon arrival we were hit with a massive storm. As you’ll read below from Kai’s first dispatch upon arrival in the port of Padang. We had gathered Craig Anderson, Chippa Wilson, Eric Geiselman, Lee Wilson, Dillon Perillo and Yago Dora, a dream crew and a dream location. But, that’s only the beginning.",2017-02-27T10:48:11-05:00,1526351257,641,205903497,20,46476,1081,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/620791402_780x439.webp

300,205209634,Cream,"The film takes place in a doctor's waiting room where soothing music and the opportunity to enjoy an ice cream brings about an alleviating atmosphere. What could possibly go wrong in a healthcare institution where help is nearby? The cold and ugly sides of human nature reveal themselves as the narrative touches on the cycle of birth and death and the absurdity of life. Let's hope the doctor can help!

301,205018000,1976,"1976 meditates on presentiment and sound. The surreal short crafts an unsettling atmosphere of foreshadowing and immanent change. A clever combination of live footage and CGI, the film allows its soundtrack to drive the visuals. Everyday objects reverberate, twist and react to an oncoming pulse of events as they converge on a farmhouse lost in rural America.

302,199615452,Fingers of Steel,"Chris Heck fought his way up over the most dangerous, lifethreatening tricks, with numerous sore finger injuryies, and nerval breakdowns to where he is today.
Since winning the German championship in 2003, he worked everyday on his inventive tricks while phoning with his wife wife Anna, on his wooden kitchen table.
Through this hard training his fingers became harder than any industry steal you can buy.
His Pro Model, with a a red Skwirral, (which is his favorite animal, right after turtles and foxes) crowns his legendary 21 years of Finger Skateboarding.

Ladies and gentlemen.

303,204400073,The Story of the Re-Evaluated,"There is an ongoing story in the history of cinema about films that are derided and rejected upon release but then completely re-assessed years later. Titles like Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, Vertigo, It's a Wonderful Life, and more all share this in common. Let's talk about this concept of re-evaluation and what it means, if anything at all, for the future.

Music by - Federico Durand

https://finisterre.com/common-ground

November saw the team gather for the first time deep in NW Ireland. For some this was the first meet, for others a welcome reunion of familiar faces. We walked far, ate well, surfed hard and lived for a while, sharing stories. Every one of us had been introduced to the sea by our parents, be they surfers, farmers, teachers or sailors. The conversation moved onto how it had shaped our lives, and shed light on what may lie in our futures. 

A lot went on in 2016 for the Finisterre Ambassadors. Fergal Smith stood as a candidate in last year’s Irish General Election and worked up on the Moy Hill Community Farm, showing us how to reconnect to the land. Noah Lane continued to push the boundaries of cold water surfing, winning the Wave of the Winter. Our team manager Matt Smith co-founded Backwash, a print anthology about surf and culture, as well as Hometree, an Irish re-forestation initiative. Easkey Britton finished her doctorate and founded Waves of Freedom. Sam Bleakley also finished his PhD, flying to all corners of the globe using surfing to affect change and deliver a positive social impact. Newcomer Sandy Kerr got engaged to his childhood sweetheart Rachel, bought a house and is spreading the word of surf and healthy living to younger generations in the North East. 

We left with a further shared sense of purpose and common ground, excited to see where our paths take us in 2017 and beyond.",2017-01-31T06:35:01-05:00,514080222,324,201834586,10,34773,575,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/615703108_780x439.webp
